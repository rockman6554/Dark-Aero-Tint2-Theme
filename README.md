# Dark Aero Tint2 Theme
My attempt for bring the vista aero theme using tint2 focused for red color palette.

Only works for Window Managers like Openbox, and requires `jgmenu` as start menu, and the Segoe UI fonts family.

Inspired from Windows Vista, with **transparency**, simple but pretty and almost **Aero** if you use `picom` too...

Includes the old Arch logo in red, just put the image in `$HOME/.icons`. You can use any image for the logo.

# How to install
Put `red-aero.tint2rc` file into `$HOME/.config/tint2`

That's it!
